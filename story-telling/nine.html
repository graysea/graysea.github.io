    <p>I learned this one the hard way. I grew up thinking that it isn't really worth getting to know people and being vulnerable with others because it's impossible for anyone to stay with you forever. People move, you move. People change, you change. And unfortunately, people perish. <i>But</i> that should give all the more reason to take the chance to connect with people. Life would be quite dull without ever having a true friend, wouldn't it?</p>
