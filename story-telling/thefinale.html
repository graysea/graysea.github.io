    <p>All things, good or bad, must come to an end.</p>
    <p>Whether you're ready to move on or not, everything has an ending. I like to evaluate and reflect every now and again on how much I've grown. Every experience you gain is not about the pursuit of perfection, rather, it is about the pursuit of <i>progression</i>.</p>
