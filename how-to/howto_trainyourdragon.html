        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>Assuming you've got yourself with a dragon or are looking to start a new relationship with one, the first thing to do is remind yourself that this is no easy task. After all, it's not an everyday task to decide to become friends with a "ferocious beast" that all our Viking fathers call vermin. So give yourself a pat on the back and be ready to make some mistakes! Most importantly: Remember that dragon training is not about having a cool pet dragon does does your bidding. It's about creating a bond of friendship between dragons and humans. Let's get started!</p>

        <h2>The <i>Actual</i> Training</h2>

            <h3>Fish are Friends</h3>
        
            <blockquote cite="http://www.schoolofdragons.com/how-to-train-your-dragon/game-guide/guide-to-train-your-dragon">The way to a dragon’s heart is through its stomach.</blockquote>
            
            <p>First things first: Dragons love fish.</p>
            <p>Like many creatures and beings, trust starts with food. It may take a few tries, but be persistent and proceed with caution. Lure the dragon of your choice with fish. Be sure not to keep them on your person or to lure it too close at first. They are still in training after all and your safety is priority!</p>
            
            <p>You may be able to communicate to your dragon with using fish as a reward. Encourage your dragon when it shows behavior that you would encourage. <em>e.g Showing hostile behavior: no fish. Retracting its teeth and/or claws: fish granted.</em></p>

            <h3>Pet at Your Own Risk</h3>
            <p>Once your dragon has begun to recognize you with repeated exposure and repeated fish treats, it may start to approach you without hostility or aggressive behavior. <i>Congratulations!</i> Your dragon is beginning to trust you! Normally, dragons will not allow foreigners to come too close. This is a milestone in your relationship with your dragon, and this is an opportunity to pet your dragon.</p>
            
            <p>Your dragon probably has never been pet before, but whether they know it or now, dragons love being pet! Approaching your dragon very cautiously, meet your dragon halfway as to not scare it and slowly leave your hand out in front of you. Make your dragon comfortable by not being too aggressive or quick with your movements. Slow and cautious is key, but all dragons have different personalities so adjust your approach to your dragon!</p>
            
            <p><em>Tip:  Dragons love belly pats and often fall asleep very quickly if pet here!</em></p>
            
            <p>A dragon's willingness to be pet by you is significant in your relationship with him/her and it should not be taken lightly. This is the dragon's way of acknowledging you as a friend and its willingness to befriend you!</p>

            <h3>Flying</h3>
            <p>Finally, the bond between a Viking and dragon is solidified when a dragon allows you to ride on its back. Being able to soar through the air on your dragon is the ultimate gesture of friendship, trust, and loyalty. In a sense, this act is the dragon’s way of thanking a Viking for caring for it and being a good friend. Dragons remember these things and will return the favor once they feel a rider is someone they consider to be an important part of their life. Aside from showing trust, a dragon loves being able to get out and fly freely. Think of it like walking a dog. Flying with your dragon is a great way to spend time with them in their natural environment and doing so will cause your relationship to strengthen.</p>

            <h2>Congratulations!</h2>
            <p>Dragons are not complicated creatures and have emotions much like humans. Being committed in your relationship with your dragon may be difficult at first if your dragon misbehaves but will pay off as your dragon matures and learns to trust you. Take note of some of the tips mentioned above and be aware of your dragon’s unique traits, likes, and dislikes. The best way to train your dragon is to have a strong bond and any Viking that remembers that will be successful.</p>
