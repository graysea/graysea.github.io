		<h2>Additive</h2>
		<p>Additive color is color created by mixing a number of different light colors, with Red, green, and blue being the primary colors normally used in additive color system. Additive color is in contrast to subtractive color, in which colors are created by subtracting (absorbing) parts of the spectrum of light present in ordinary white light, by means of colored pigments or dyes, such as those in paints, inks, and the three dye layers in typical color photographs on film.</p>
		<h2>Subtractive</h2>
		<p>A subtractive color model explains the mixing of a limited set of dyes, inks, paint pigments or natural colorants to create a wider range of colors, each the result of partially or completely subtracting (that is, absorbing) some wavelengths of light and not others. The color that a surface displays depends on which parts of the visible spectrum are not absorbed and therefore remain visible. Subtractive color systems start with light, presumably white light. Colored inks, paints, or filters between the watchers and the light source or reflective surface subtract wavelengths from the light, giving it color. If the incident light is other than white, our visual mechanisms are able to compensate well, but not perfectly, often giving a flawed impression of the "true" color of the surface.</p>

		<h2>Theory of Color</h2>
		<p>Color theory is a body of practical guidance to color mixing and the visual effects of a specific color combination. There are also definitions (or categories) of colors based on the color wheel: primary color, secondary color and tertiary color.</p>
		<h3>Primary</h3>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Red</li>
    		<li>Blue</li>
    		<li>Yellow</li>
    	</ul>
		<h3>Secondary</h3>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Orange</li>
    		<li>Green</li>
    		<li>Violet</li>
    	</ul>
		<h3>Tertiary</h3>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Violet-Red</li>
    		<li>Blue-Violet</li>
    		<li>Green-Blue</li>
        	<li>Yellow-Green</li>
        	<li>Orange-Yellow</li>
        	<li>Red-Orange</li>
    	</ul>

		<h2>Color Models</h2>
		<p>A color model is a system for creating a full range of colours from a small set of primary colors. There are two types of colour models: additive and subtractive. Additive color models use light to display color, while subtractive color models use printing inks. The most common color models that graphic designers work with are the CMYK model for printing and the RGB model for computer display.</p>
		<h3>Analogous</h3>
		<p>Analogous color schemes use colors that are next to each other on the color wheel. They usually match well and create serene and comfortable designs. Analogous color schemes are often found in nature and are harmonious and pleasing to the eye. Make sure you have enough contrast when choosing an analogous color scheme. Choose one color to dominate, a second to support. The third color is used (along with black, white or gray) as an accent.</p>
		<h3>Monochromatic</h3>
		<p>Monochrome describes paintings, drawings, design, or photographs in one color or values of one color. A monochromatic object or image reflects colors in shades of limited colors or hues.</p>
		<h3>Triadic</h3>
		<p>A triadic color scheme uses colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel. Triadic color harmonies tend to be quite vibrant, even if you use pale or unsaturated versions of your hues. To use a triadic harmony successfully, the colors should be carefully balanced - let one color dominate and use the two others for accent.</p>
		<h3>Complementary</h3>
		<p>Colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel are considered to be complementary colors (example: red and green). The high contrast of complementary colors creates a vibrant look especially when used at full saturation. This color scheme must be managed well so it is not jarring. Complementary colors are tricky to use in large doses, but work well when you want something to stand out.</p>
